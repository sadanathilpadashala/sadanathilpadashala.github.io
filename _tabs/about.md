Sadanathil Padashala is an elementary school recognised by the Kerala govt located at Manamboor village at Alamcode, Attingal, Thiruvananthapuram. for the native kids-Age group 4 to 12.

We aim to bring changes in how young kids are being taught and taught, support the native students, give an inclusive environment, work as an awareness group to empower teachers, parents, and students, and do continuous research on elementary education.
 
It is a place where living and learning are natural for students, teachers, and the community. It also gives space for many living things to co-exist. We aim for cooperative, participative, age-appropriate, and real-time-based learning. 

Learning should be natural, and all should enjoy the learning process. We hope such a space allows for a deep sense of joy, sensitivity, awareness, and well-being within each individual and society.
